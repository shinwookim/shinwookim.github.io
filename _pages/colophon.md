# Colophon
This website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator written in Ruby. The theme was created using [Bootstrap 5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/), a free and open-source CSS framework. The site is built using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) which publishes the final artifacts to some Unix machine maintained by the University of Pittsburgh that also happens to be running a Apache server.
