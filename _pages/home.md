> _I am currently completing my [compulsory military service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_South_Korea) with a scheduled discharge date of September 2025. During this time, I am not able to readily respond to communications via email, social media, etc._

I am a software developer and computer scientist with a strong interest in **building reliable (distributed) systems**—although there are very few things in computer science that I'm _not_ interested in. I was previously affiliated with the [School of Computing and Information](https://sci.pitt.edu) at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://pitt.edu), where I earned both a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in computer science.

During my time at Pitt, I engaged in innovative research and non-research [projects](./projects/), [taught](./teaching/) exceptional students, and advocated for equity and inclusion in STEM education.
